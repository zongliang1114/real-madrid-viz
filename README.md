# real-madrid-viz

## Description:
Real Madrid is one of the greatest soccer teams in the world. They won three UEFA Championship in the recent four years. As a big Real Madrid fan, I collected personal ability data of the eleven starters, personal offensive and defensive data of the eleven starters in UEFA Champion match and the team data of the final match. 
As we all know, soccer is a classic team work match. Different players have different positions, and different positions have different missions. My aim is to show how the personal abilities transfer and support the whole team to win the championship. 

I donâ€™t have much coding experience but I was not willing to compromise on my vision. Instead of feeling limited by my coding abilities, I decided to prototype my idea in Invision to show the interactions that I plan my visualization to have.

I then passed my prototype along to [@sandywij](https://github.com/sandywij/) and she is currently trying to help me code this. Her feedback was that my prototype was very clear and she was able to work independently on the code. This gave me the experience of how it might be like prototyping and collaborating with a developer.

She used google font API to get the roboto Font. You can see the bootstrap, css and javasrcipt file however, Sandy did not use them. And the d3 tip library, it creates the tooltips.

She used css to make the style part. Using google chrome, I inspected her code and I see that the styles were applied on the field svg. Fill and the stroke are different color by typing #97ccad, #8ac273, we have two different shade of screen. The stroke-width is 5px. Sandy told me that she exported the svg code from my Ai file.

This is what I learned how to export the svg file from Ai.
