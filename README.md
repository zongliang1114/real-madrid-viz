# real-madrid-viz

## Description:
Real Madrid is one of the greatest soccer teams in the world. They won three UEFA Championship in the recent four years. As a big Real Madrid fan, I collected personal ability data of the eleven starters, personal offensive and defensive data of the eleven starters in UEFA Champion match and the team data of the final match. 
As we all know, soccer is a classic team work match. Different players have different positions, and different positions have different missions. My aim is to show how the personal abilities transfer and support the whole team to win the championship. 

I donâ€™t have much coding experience but I was not willing to compromise on my vision. Instead of feeling limited by my coding abilities, I decided to prototype my idea in Invision to show the interactions that I plan my visualization to have.

I then passed my prototype along to @sandywij and she is currently trying to help me code this. Her feedback was that my prototype was very clear and she was able to work independently on the code. This gave me the experience of how it might be like prototyping and collaborating with a developer.
